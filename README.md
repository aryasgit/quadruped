Phase 2 — Actuator & Control Bring-Up
A) Initial actuator bring-up
sercon_v1.MOV
First successful servo motion achieved using individual PWM commands generated by a custom serial control script. This milestone validates power distribution, PWM timing, and actuator responsiveness during early hardware bring-up.

B) Serial control refinement
serconv2.MOV
Improved serial control script with stabilized PWM sequencing and reduced jitter, enabling repeatable individual joint actuation prior to closed-loop control.

Phase 3 — Stability & Load Management
E) Brace detection
Brace.MOV
Demonstration of leg bracing behavior used to stabilize the robot during support phases and transitions.

F) Unload behavior
Unload.MOV / Unload 2.mov
Controlled leg unloading sequence designed to transfer load before lift and swing phases safely.

G) GUI-assisted unload monitoring
Unload_GUI.MOV
Visualization of unload state transitions and control parameters via a custom monitoring GUI.
