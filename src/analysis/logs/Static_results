1️⃣ What this plot is telling us (important)
Top plot — Roll vs Posture Roll

Blue (roll): real IMU roll

Orange (posture_roll): intentional bias (target lean)

What we see:

Roll stays within ±0.02° → excellent passive stability

Posture roll ≈ 0 → no gait/unload bias active (good baseline run)

No drift → IMU calibration + complementary filter are working

✅ This means Layer-1 balance is solid

Middle plot — roll_effort vs offset_change

roll_effort: how hard the controller wanted to correct

offset_change: how much the shoulders actually moved

What we see:

Small spikes during disturbances

offset_change ≈ 0 most of the time → servos aren’t chattering

✅ This confirms:

PD gains are not aggressive

You are not fighting noise

No control wind-up

This is exactly what a good reflex layer looks like.

Bottom plot — brace

1 = brace triggered

0 = normal operation

What we see:

One clean brace event at the start

No false triggers afterward

✅ Brace logic is correctly tuned
(no random spikes, no re-trigger loops)
